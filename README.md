# Hands on Stuff

As I began my journey in Data Science I realized it would be a good practice to keep publishing what I was playing with.

This is when I started this repository where all posts would go. This repository does not mean to be a tutorial rather to serve as reference lookup.

Below is the index of all the posts:

<b> Plotting UFO Sightings data (ufo notebook.nb): </b> Contains some plottings and modification of data as per requirements.

<b> Suicide Info: </b> Contains code for how different plots can be created between two variables.

<b> How well is your sleep !: </b> Just some transformations on how we can bring the data into the form we need. We utilize the sleep data from Kaggle to understand 

<b> Analyzing Sleep Data </b>: Here we see how to implement Regression in the Sleep Data 

<b> Multiple Variable Regression </b>: In this post we study how to include more than one features in our model.

<b> Understanding SVM </b>: In this post we study how to implement classification using Support Vector Machines. We implement the Kernel for 4 cities of Australia: Perth, Adelaide, Darwin and Sydney

<b> Analysis 911 Emergency Dataset </b>: In this post we work with the 911 Emergency Calls Dataset available on Kaggle. We explore the data and try to find the insights of type of call versus different attributes. You can find the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert" target="_blank">here</a>
