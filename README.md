# Hands on Stuff

As I began my journey in Data Science I realized it would be a good practice to keep publishing what I was playing with.

This is when I started this repository where all posts would go. This repository does not mean to be a tutorial rather to serve as reference lookup.

Below is the index of all the posts:

<b> Plotting UFO Sightings data (ufo notebook.nb): </b> Contains some plottings and modification of data as per requirements.

<b> Suicide Info </b>: Contains code for how different plots can be created between two variables.
